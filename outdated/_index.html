										competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these Terms &amp;
										Conditions to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms &amp; Conditions
										will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these
										Terms &amp; Conditions will be effective only if in writing and signed by an

											Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong><br />We may be collecting and using
										information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in
										this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why
										is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from
										being replicated or used in the wrong way.</span><span class="p"><strong>What is
											GDPR?</strong><br />GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that
										regulates how EU residents&#39; data is protected by companies and enhances the
										control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</span><span
										class="p">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just
										the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is important
										irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR
										controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</span><span
										class="p"><strong>What is personal data?</strong><br />Any data that relates to
										an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of
										information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces
										of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s
										name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political
										opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
										orientation, and ethnicity.</span><span class="p">The Data Protection Principles
										include requirements such as:</span><span class="p">Personal data collected must
										be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a
										way that a person would reasonably expect.<br />Personal data should only be
										collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that
										purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they
										collect it.<br />Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil
										its purpose.<br />People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own
										personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data
										be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</span><span
										class="p"><strong>Why is GDPR important?</strong><br />GDPR adds some new
										requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals&#39; personal
										data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by
										increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts
										it&#39;s simply the right thing to do. At PresentationGPT we strongly believe
										that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and
										privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new
										regulation.</span><span class="p"><strong>Individual Data Subject&#39;s Rights -
											Data Access, Portability and Deletion</strong><br />We are committed to
										helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
										PresentationGPT processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA
										compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6
										years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in
										accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it
										longer than 60 days.</span><span class="p">We are aware that if you are working
										with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to
